    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes it seems like eating protein is relegated to either shakes or meat â€“ and those two things can get kinda
        boring. Thankfully, I discovered the joy of mug cakes! You literally put all the ingredients in a mug, microwave
        it, and bam! You have a delicious dessert!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp oat flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chocolate protein powder</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup almond milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
