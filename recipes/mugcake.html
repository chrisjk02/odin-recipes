    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes it seems like eating protein is relegated to either shakes or meat â€“ and those two things can get kinda
        boring. Thankfully, I discovered the joy of mug cakes! You literally put all the ingredients in a mug, microwave
        it, and bam! You have a delicious dessert!</p>
